### Project structure

The following command lists the __structure__ of the project per the current version.

```sh
$ ./schema.sh
```

Overall, the `bin` folder contains strictly `executables`, `database` contains supported __word-lists__, `dist` stores locally parsed data from an __API__. We can find several `.sh`, `.h` and `.c` files in the root of the project. Lastly, `package.json` contains a `node dependency`.
